<!--
    force-sobject-store element wraps the SmartSync Force.StoreCache into a polymer element.
    Why: a) Auto manages the lifecycle of the smartstore soup for each sobject type.
    b) Auto creates index spec based on the lookup relationships on the sobject.
    c) Provides a simpler DOM based interface to interact with Smartsync SObject Model.
    d) Allows other polymer elements to easily comsume smartstore.

    @attributes:
    sobject: (Required) Type of sobject that you would like to store in this cache.
    fieldstoindex: (Optional) Addition fields (given by their name) that you want to have indexes on.

    @properties:
    cacheReady: Returns a promise to track store cache creation progress.
    cache: Returns an instance of Force.StoreCache when it's ready to store/retrieve data.
    cacheForOriginals: Returns an instance of Force.StoreCache to be used to keep data copy for conflict resolution.

    @events:
    store-ready: Fires this event when the store cache has been successfully created and ready to use.
