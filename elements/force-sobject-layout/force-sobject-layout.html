<!--
    force-sobject-layout element provides the layout information for a particular sobject record.
    Why: a) Wraps the describeLayout API call.
    b) Layout information is cached in memory for existing session and stored in smartstore for offline consumption.
    c) Provides a base definition for elements that depend on page layouts, such as force-ui-detail and force-sobject-related.

    @attributes:
    sobject: (Required) Type of sobject on which you want to fetch the layout
    hasrecordtypes: (Optional) Default: false. If false, the element returns the default layout. Set true if the sobject has recordtypes or if you are unsure. If set to true, "recordid" or "recordtypeid" must be provided.
    recordtypeid: (Optional) Default: null. Id of the record type for which layout has to be fetched. Required if "hasrecordtypes" is true and "recordid" is not provided.
    recordid: (Optional) Default: null. Id of the record for which layout has to be fetched. Required if "hasrecordtypes" is true and "recordtypeid" is not provided.
